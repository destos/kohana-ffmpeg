#About This Module

This module was created during a startup weekend event, and was used to grab frames from videos for our demo. Given our time constraints of a weekend this code isn't as modular or usable as it should be.

IF you are interested in using this module, please help us make it better!

##Usage

You first need ffmpeg installed localy or on your production/dev server. Use whatever install method is available. Note the instalation location and change the config accordingly.

Instalation with macports

*sudo port install ffmpeg*
